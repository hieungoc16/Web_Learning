            <h2><em>1. The zone of interest</em></h2>
            <p>
                A great artist can offer a radical new perspective on a
                well-trodden subject. So it is with Jonathan Glazer’s Holocaust
                masterpiece, which takes Hannah Arendt’s phrase ‘the banality of
                evil’ and shows us what banal evil really looks like.<b>
                    The family</b
                >
                life of Auschwitz camp commandant Rudolf Höss
                <em>(Christian Friedel)</em> and his wife
                <em>(Sandra Hüller)</em> is a vision of cursed domesticity. The
                horrors remain out of sight but, crucially, not out of earshot.
                Sound designer Johnnie Burn’s soundscape has the yelling of
                guards and the crack of rifle shots punctuating scenes of
                gardening and kids’ playing. The result is a Come and See for
                the 2020s.

            <h3><em>2. Poor things</em></h3>
            <p>
                Sensual coming-of-age journey on helium or problematic story of
                sexual exploitation? The conversation came late to Yorgos
                Lanthimos’s singular adaptation of Scottish writer Alasdair
                Gray’s cult 1992 novel, but it came pretty hard. And yet, with
                <b>Dogtooth</b>,<b> The Lobster</b> and
                <b>The Favourite</b> behind him, the Greek is a master of
                creating lopsided, not-for-everyone visions of the human
                experience – and this Victorian Frankenstein riff, in which a
                magnet Emma Stone plays a lustier-than-normal version of the
                monster, is no exception. Surely the most bonkers film to score
                11 Oscars nominations.
